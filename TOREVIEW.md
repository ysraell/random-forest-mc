Overall Assessment

  The code implements a sophisticated Random Forest algorithm with advanced features like Monte Carlo tree selection, parallel training, feature importance
  analysis, and handling of missing values. The use of typing and docstrings is commendable. However, there are several areas that could be improved, ranging
  from a critical bug to performance and style issues.

  1. Critical Issues

   * Bug in `__init__`: The call to the parent class constructor is incorrect.
       * Location: line 160
       * Issue: super.__init__(...) will raise an AttributeError.
       * Fix: It should be super().__init__(...).

  2. Major Performance & Design Issues

   * Feature Importance Calculation: The current method for determining feature importance is inefficient and fragile because it relies on converting the tree
     object to a string and searching for feature names.
       * Location: lines 500, 516, 533, 553
       * Issue: Methods like featImportance, featScoreMean, and featPairImportance use expressions like f"'{feat}'" in str(Tree). This is slow, and it will break
         if the __str__ representation of the DecisionTreeMC object changes. The tree2feats method also suffers from this by parsing the string representation.
       * Recommendation: The DecisionTreeMC object already seems to store the features it uses in the used_features attribute (as assigned in survivedTree). The
         importance-related methods should be refactored to use this attribute directly.

    1         # Example for featImportance
    2         def featImportance(self, Forest: Optional[List[DecisionTreeMC]] = None) -> Dict[featName, float]:
    3             if Forest is None:
    4                 Forest = self.data
    5             n_trees = len(Forest)
    6             importance = defaultdict(int)
    7             for tree in Forest:
    8                 for feat in tree.used_features:
    9                     importance[feat] += 1
   10             return {feat: count / n_trees for feat, count in importance.items()}

  3. Minor Issues & Code Style Suggestions

   * Redundant Code:
       * Location: line 168
       * Issue: self.dataset = None is assigned twice in the __init__ method. The second assignment can be removed.

   * Obscure "Tricks":
       * Location: lines 231, 270, 620, 629, 640
       * Issue: The code contains comments like # Coverage trick! followed by _ = None. This is not standard practice and harms readability. The code would
         function identically without these lines. They should be removed.

   * Silent `dropna()`:
       * Location: line 192
       * Issue: self.dataset = dataset.dropna() silently drops rows with missing values. A user might not expect this behavior.
       * Recommendation: Add a warning using the log module or at least document this behavior clearly in the process_dataset docstring.

   * Randomness:
       * Location: line 241
       * Issue: The code uses random.randint and random.sample. In a library that already depends heavily on NumPy, it's better practice to use numpy.random for
         generating random numbers. This allows for better control over the random seed for reproducibility.

   * Complex Logic:
       * Location: predictMissingValues method, lines 654-685
       * Issue: The logic for handling missing values is quite complex, involving multiple steps of DataFrame filtering, concatenation, and manipulation. This
         makes it difficult to understand and debug.
       * Recommendation: Consider breaking down the logic into smaller, well-named helper methods. Add comments to explain the purpose of each major step in the
         process.
